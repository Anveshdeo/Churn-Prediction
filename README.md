# Churn-Prediction
Churn prediction is one of the most popular Big Data use cases in business. It consists of detecting customers who are likely to cancel a subscription to a service.

Although originally a telcom giant thing, this concerns businesses of all sizes, including startups.
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs."

**We want to predict the answer to the following question, asked for each current customer: “Is this customer going to leave us within the next X months?” There are only two possible answers, yes or no, and it is what we call a binary classification task. Here, the input of the task is a customer and the output is the answer to the question (yes or no).**
